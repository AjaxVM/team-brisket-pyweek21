ABOUT:

Releasing as public domain. Check LICENSE.txt for assets.
Game is supposed to be a post-apocalyptic coop platform where you run from zombies.
Since we ran out of time we have more of a coop jump on peopleâ€™s heads and chase flying plants thing.
Have fun, if you can!


TIPS:

If you are running El Capitan,
there is a bug where the version of SDL_Image is not compatible with
the latest version of Pygame.
The fix for this is detailed here: http://editcode.info/a/35385411
