TODO!!!

Need to briefly mention license, and direct to LICENSE.txt for details.
Need to specify which libraries/versions are needed to run game.
Need a brief blurb about game/credits/etc.

NOTE: if you are running El Capitan,
there is a bug where the version of SDL_Image is not compatible with
the latest version of Pygame.
The fix for this is detailed here: http://editcode.info/a/35385411
